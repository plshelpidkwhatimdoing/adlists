# adlists
for adlists that I want to maintain myself
if you want to use this, feel free
I have gone through them and there should be no duplicate domains in any of these lists

commands.txt is NOT a domain list, it just has useful commands in it that I don't want to forget

- ads: large list of ads
- amp hosts: a list of accelerated mobile pages (amp) domains that often are ads or trackers
- experimental: a short list of domains that I put there to see if blocking them breaks anything (i dont recommend using it)
- fake news: a list a fake news sites
- gambling: list of known gambling sites
- porn: list of useless porn sites
- porn2: split porn.txt in half because github 100mb file size limit
- malicious: combined list of domains used for phishing, ransomware, cryptojacking, abuse, fraud, redirect, spam, and scam
- malicious2: same reason as porn2
- suspicious: a list of suspicious sites you probably shouldnt visit
- tiktok: list of everything tiktok
- useless sites: sites that arent worth visiting
- lgbidgaf: sites of perverts from the rainbow mafia
